Well I'am usually using php to solve web challanges at ctf but python is also good to do that.
since I'am new to learn python I facing some problem that weird because I didn't know what the detail of the library 
Nah , Now here we are talking about urllib,urllib2,mechanize,request 

We will take a look deeper in that library soon
