A regular individual with a deep-seated passion for information security, my academic journey started in software development but eventually led me down the path to becoming a seasoned cybersecurity professional. I actively engage in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and Bug Bounty programs to continuously refine and stay current with my skills in the dynamic security industry.

The most exhilarating aspect of hacking lies in the discovery of vulnerabilities that may have been overlooked by others. In truth, any vulnerability with substantial implications provides an immense rush of satisfaction. Beyond that, a key trait required for success in Bug Bounty hunting and bug identification is unwavering persistence.
